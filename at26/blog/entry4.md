Wow, another train ride, and this one is the express one!

Geez, I feel like I have less and less time to work on this project! Damn

Well, last week I didn't do much, I had covid and I felt like garbage, I tried though
but I didn't much energy left.

Today, as soon as I started typing I realised I almost on final stop. This is indeed
annoying. I tried to work during the night, but I had less energy left then
because work. This weekend I did a massive refactor that of course no one appreciated
because who appreciates refactors? But it had to be done, the code was a mess 
and working on the feature I'm working on felt like adding ductape and I don't
care about recognition or not, it was a thing that needed to be done. Unfortunately,
it took my free time from the weekend and I couldn't work on this project.

Anyway, enough ranting. I'm already at Central, but I'm getting back into traction
I just started the part that draws the dino, I'm strobing the RESP0 register 
in which would be the locked x-dino position. I'll go back to this later today, 
hopefully.
