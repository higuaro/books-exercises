# Exercises for books (or tutorials)

### Books:

* [Making games for the Atari 2600](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Games-Atari-2600-Steven/dp/1541021304) **[currently focused on this one]**.

### Tutorials:

* [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/): Excellent place to learn or refresh OGL, specially _new_ OGL.

### Almost abandoned:

* [Dynamic Programming for the coding
interview](https://www.amazon.com.au/Dynamic-Programming-Coding-Interviews-Bottom-Up-ebook/dp/B06XZ61CMP): Arguably one of best sources out there to pedagogically understand DP.

### Abandoned:

* [Functional Programming In
Scala](https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Programming-Scala-Paul-Chiusano/dp/1617290653)
(a.k.a the red book)
